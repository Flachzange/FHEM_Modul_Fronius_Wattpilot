# FHEM Module: 72_Wattpilot.pm - User Guide

This document describes the installation and configuration of the Fronius Wattpilot module for FHEM. The module allows control of the Wallbox over the local network via WebSocket.

Current module version: **1.3.0**. Dennis Gramespacher remains the original author; Flachzange maintains this repository. Protocol-source provenance and confidence are documented in [`docs/PROTOCOL-SOURCES.md`](docs/PROTOCOL-SOURCES.md).

## 1. Prerequisites (System & Perl Modules)

For the module to work, some additional Perl modules must be installed on the server (Raspberry Pi, PC, etc.) running FHEM. The module uses modern encryption (PBKDF2), which is not always installed by default.

### Required Perl Packages

* `JSON`
* `Crypt::PBKDF2`
* `Crypt::Bcrypt`
* `Digest::SHA`
* `MIME::Base64`

### Installing Packages (Debian/Raspbian/Ubuntu)

Run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libjson-perl libdigest-sha-perl libmime-base64-perl
```

For `Crypt::PBKDF2` and `Crypt::Bcrypt` (often not available as an apt package), it is best to use cpanminus:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cpanminus
sudo cpanm Crypt::PBKDF2 Crypt::Bcrypt
```

## 2. Installing the Module

1. Download the file `72_Wattpilot.pm`.
2. Copy the file to the FHEM installation directory, specifically into the `FHEM` folder.
    * Default path (Linux): `/opt/fhem/FHEM/`
    * Example command: `cp 72_Wattpilot.pm /opt/fhem/FHEM/`
3. Set the correct permissions (optional, but recommended):

    ```bash
    sudo chown fhem:dialout /opt/fhem/FHEM/72_Wattpilot.pm
    sudo chmod 644 /opt/fhem/FHEM/72_Wattpilot.pm
    ```

4. Restart FHEM (enter `shutdown restart` in FHEM) or reload the module with `reload 72_Wattpilot`.

## 3. Setup in FHEM (Definition)

To integrate the Wallbox into FHEM, create a new "Device".

### Syntax

```text
define <Name> Wattpilot <IP-Address> [Serial]
```

* **<Name>**: A name for the device in FHEM (e.g., `wallbox` or `myWattpilot`).
* **<IP-Address>**: The local IP address of the Wattpilot on the network (e.g., `192.0.2.10`, reserved for documentation).
* **[Serial]** (Optional): The serial number of the box. If omitted, the module attempts to read it automatically.

**Note:** The password is no longer specified in the definition, but set separately using the `set Password` command.

### Example

Enter this into the FHEM command line:

```text
define testWallbox Wattpilot 192.0.2.10 10000001
set testWallbox Password documentation-value-only
```

## 4. Functions & Commands (Control)

Once the device is defined, you must first set the password:

### Set Password

Stores the password persistently in FHEM (encrypted in the FHEM database, not in the `fhem.cfg`).

```text
set wallbox Password <YourPassword>
```

After that, the module connects automatically. Once the status is `connected`, you can control it.

The password and its derived authentication value are stored under a stable FUUID-based key. Existing name-based keys are removed only after the new value has been stored successfully during load or rename. If rename migration fails, former names are persisted separately for password and password hash as non-sensitive, FUUID-related pending metadata. This keeps retries possible across `rereadcfg`, reload, restart, and a newly created device hash. The metadata is removed after successful migration or deletion. `rereadcfg`, reload, disable, and normal undefine do not delete credentials; only actually deleting the FHEM device removes them.

When changing the password, the module first invalidates every known stable and name-based password hash. It then stores the new stable password and removes remaining legacy passwords. If any step fails, completed changes are rolled back from values read beforehand and FHEM receives an error. Before changing anything, `DeleteFn` snapshots every stable, known legacy, and pending-metadata value. Read or delete failures abort the operation and restore values already deleted; an incomplete rollback is reported explicitly so FHEM does not finalize deletion. After the real FHEM sequence `UndefFn` followed by a failed `DeleteFn`, the module restores `defptr`, an honest state, and exactly one reconnect timer only when the retained device is enabled and has a password.

### Start / Stop Charging

Manually starts or stops the charging process.

```text
set wallbox Laden_starten Start
set wallbox Laden_starten Stop
```

### Change Current (Amperes)

Sets the charging current in Amperes (between 6A and 32A).

```text
set wallbox Strom 16
```

Tip: In the FHEM interface, this often appears as a slider.

### Change Mode

Changes the operating mode of the Wallbox.

```text
set wallbox Modus Eco
set wallbox Modus NextTrip
set wallbox Modus Default
```

### Set Next Trip Time

Sets the desired time for the "Next Trip" mode.

```text
set wallbox Zeit_NextTrip 07:30
```

Format: `hh:mm`

## 5. Configuration (Attributes)

You can adjust the module's behavior via "Attributes".

### `interval` (in seconds)

Determines how often **high-frequency readings** (Voltage, Power, Current) are updated.

* Default: `0` (Every change is shown immediately -> can fill the log "Spam").
* Recommendation: `10` or `60`.
* *Note:* Important changes (charging starts, car plugged in) are always shown **immediately**, regardless of the interval.

### `update_while_idle` (0 or 1)

Controls whether readings are updated when the car is **not** charging.

* `0` (Default): If not charging, Voltage/Power are not updated to save system load (since mostly 0).
* `1`: Updates values even when idle (e.g., for troubleshooting or monitoring grid voltage). Only applies in combination with `interval`.

### `disable` (0 or 1)

Completely disables the module.

* `0` (Default): Module is active and connects.
* `1`: Module is deactivated, connection is closed, and no new connection attempts are made. Useful during maintenance.

### `verbose` (0 to 5)

Controls the verbosity of log entries in the FHEM log file.

* `1`: Errors only.
* `2`: Important events (e.g., login successful).
* `3`: Logs sent commands.
* `4`: Logs received data from Wattpilot.
* `5`: Debugging. Complete JSON messages remain suppressed unless `rawJsonLog=1` is also set.

### `rawJsonLog` (0 or 1)

The default is `0`. Complete inbound and outbound JSON messages are logged only when both `rawJsonLog=1` and `verbose=5` are set. This includes authentication and `securedMsg` frames. Enabling the attribute emits a security warning: raw data can contain authentication, network, device, and operational data. Enable it only briefly for targeted diagnostics and never share raw output without sanitizing it first.

The module uses a central write path for outbound JSON. It suppresses DevIo's own level-5 payload log only for the synchronous write call without changing the FHEM `verbose` attribute globally or persistently. `DevIo_SimpleWrite(..., 2)` receives unpacked text; DevIo determines the WebSocket opcode from its connection and `$hash->{binary}`. Complete clear-text output from Wattpilot-owned logging is produced only by the explicit raw mode described above.

Technical limit: in inspected FHEM revision `5354e001b55c323f457bd907434e46f284d9582c`, DevIo `privacy=1` masks only the initial opening line. For WebSockets, `DevIo_OpenDev` creates an internal HttpUtils hash without `hideurl` and without inheriting `devioLoglevel`; HttpUtils can log URLs, DNS/IP results, timeouts, and connection errors at levels 4 or 5. Wattpilot preserves correct DevIo semantics for initial connection (`reopen=0`) and reconnect (`reopen=1`) and redacts its own messages, but cannot reliably suppress those transitive core logs through the public DevIo interface. Reliable full suppression requires an upstream FHEM change that passes privacy to HttpUtils as `hideurl` and provides suitable log/error redaction. Until then, high-verbose logs must not be treated as endpoint-free and must be protected and sanitized before sharing.

### `authHash` (auto, pbkdf2, bcrypt)

Selects the password hashing method.

* `auto` (Default): Automatically selects the method required by the device.
* `pbkdf2`: Forces PBKDF2 (older models).
* `bcrypt`: Forces bcrypt (newer Wattpilot Flex models).

## 6. Readings (Values)

The module provides the following values ("Readings"):

| Reading | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `state` | Connection status (initialized, connected, auth_failed, password missing, disabled). |
| `version` | Firmware / protocol version of the device. |
| `authHashMode` | Authentication method used (pbkdf2 or bcrypt). |
| `CarState` | Status of the car (Idle, Charging, WaitCar, Complete). |
| `power` | Current total power in Watts. |
| `Power_L1..3` | Power on individual phases in Watts. |
| `EnergyTotal` | Total energy counter in kWh. |
| `Voltage_L1..3` | Voltage on the 3 phases in Volts. |
| `Current_L1..3` | Current on the 3 phases in Amperes. |
| `Strom` | The current limit currently set in Wattpilot (Amperes). |
| `Laden_starten` | Status of manual charging control (Start/Stop). |
| `Modus` | Current charging mode (Eco/Default/NextTrip). |
| `Zeit_NextTrip` | Set time for Next Trip (Format hh:mm). |
| `Energie_seit_Anstecken` | Energy consumed in Wh since the car was connected. |

## 7. Troubleshooting

* **Status remains `initialized` or `disconnected`**:
  * Check the IP address. Can the FHEM server ping the IP?
  * Are FHEM and Wattpilot on the same network? (Often issues with Guest networks).
* **Log shows "Authentication Failed"**:
  * Check the password with `set <Name> Password ...`.
  * If necessary, try setting the `authHash` attribute explicitly to `pbkdf2` or `bcrypt`.
* **Perl Error in Log (`Can't locate Crypt/PBKDF2.pm`)**:
  * The prerequisites (Step 1) were not met. Install the missing Perl module.
